### What is Plustendo?

Plustendo is an **add-on network** that works alongside Nintendo and Pretendo networks. It allows players to access **additional servers and features** while keeping full compatibility with Pretendo services.  

Whether you want to expand your gaming options or keep playing Pretendo servers, Plustendo has you covered.

### Why does Plustendo exist?

Plustendo exists to **enhance your 3ds online experience** without replacing Pretendo, letting you explore new servers, play extra games, and still use your Pretendo profile.

Think of it as an upgrade rather than a replacement.
